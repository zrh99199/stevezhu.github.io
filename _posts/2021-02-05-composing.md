In this post, we'll see some examples of how to create technical posts that include Python code, explanatory text, and notes about your learnings. We'll go over the primary methods that you'll use to embed content in your posts. 

Since your primary homework posts will be based on previous work you did in a Jupyter notebook, you're likely to want to know how to easily convert a Jupyter notebook into a blog post. This [helpful guide](https://cduvallet.github.io/posts/2018/03/ipython-notebooks-jekyll) outlines the main steps.  

## File Format

Your posts should be placed in the `_posts/` directory of your website. All posts should have extension `.md` for Markdown. The filename must be of the form `YYYY-MM-DD-my-title.md`, where `YYYY-MM-DD` is a date such as `2021-04-01`. The date is somewhat arbitrary, and is used primarily to determine which posts are shown first on your blog. However, note that specifying a date in the future might cause your post not to appear because Jekyll will treat it as "not yet published." 

## Markdown Styling

You can use Markdown to style basic text, much as you do in Jupyter Notebooks. For example, you can create *italic* and **bold** text using `*`. You can also make headers like 

#### this one

by using some number of `#` symbols before your text. Fewer `#` symbols makes larger headers. 

You can also make 

1. numbered
2. lists

and 

- bulleted
- lists. 

Both of these support arbitrary nesting: 

- Make tea. 
    1. Boil water.
    2. Place tea bag in mug. 
        - Choose mug.
        - Choose teabag. 
    3. Pour water in mug.
- Read a book. 

## Math

If you are familiar with the $$\LaTeX$$ typesetting system, you can use many standard commands by enclosing them in double \$ symbols. You can make both inline math like $$f(x) = e^x$$ and display math like 

$$\sum_{i = 1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{i^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}.$$



## Code

There are two main ways to insert code in your posts. When talking about a short concept, like the `np.random.rand()` function, you can type back ticks like this: \``np.random.rand()`\`. 

To create a larger block of code, use three consecutive backticks ``` to both open and close the code block. If you place the word `python` immediately after the opening code blocks, you'll get attractive syntax highlighting: 

```python
def f(x):
    """
    A cool function that multiples an input x by 2. 
    """
    return 2*x
``` 

You can leave off the `python` syntax highlighting in order to distinguish between code and code output, which is usually not highlighted: 

```python
print("to boldly go")
```
```
to boldly go
```



## Images

You can and should include images in your posts, especially in cases where you have created a data visualization. If the image is already available online, you can link to it using the syntax `![](image_url)`: 

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.eremedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/13112109/diversity-700x439.jpg)

In cases in which your code produces an image, you should save the image (such as via `plt.savefig()`), then save it in the `images` directory. You can then embed it directly under the code that generates it on your blog post, using the code 
```
![image-example.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/image-example.png)
```
For example, here's how to show code along with the plot that it generates. 
```python
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
x = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 1001)
y = np.sin(x)
plt.plot(x, y)
```
![image-example.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/image-example.png)

To create this example, I first ran the code in a Jupyter Notebook, and added the line `plt.savefig("image-example.png")` to save the result. I then moved the file `image-example.png` to the `images/` directory of my blog. Finally, I added the line 
```
![image-example.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/image-example.png)
```
immediately beneath the code block. 


## Describing Peer Feedback

One important requirement for your homework assignments is to clearly state multiple moments in which you (a) learned something useful from your peer feedback or (b) contributed an important insight during peer feedback. This website template includes two special CSS classes that you should use for this purpose. 

To indicate a topic in which you learned something new, use the `got-help` class like this: 

```html
{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="got-help">
I learned something really cool from my peer feedback! 
</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}
```

Jekyll will process this code block like this: 

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="got-help">
I learned something really cool from my peer feedback! 
</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}

You can also use the class `gave-help` to indicate places in which you felt that your comments were able to significantly improve the code of your peers. 

```html
{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="gave-help">
I gave one of my peers a cool suggestion! 
</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}
```
{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="gave-help">
I gave one of my peers a cool suggestion! 
</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}

You are welcome (and indeed encouraged) to place code inside these blocks:

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="got-help">
In my first draft of my code, I computed the logistic sigmoid function on a list of values using: 

```python
import math
def sigmoid(X):
    return [1 / (1 + math.exp(-x)) for x in X]
```
One of my peer reviewers pointed out to me that my code would be faster on large data sets and be more compatable with scientific Python libraries if I assumed that the input and output were Numpy arrays. 
```python
import numpy as np
def sigmoid(X):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-X))
``` 
</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}
